    AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client - WebSocket client for AnyEvent

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
     use AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client;
 
     my $client = AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client->new;
 
     $client->connect("ws://localhost:1234")->cb(sub {
       my $connection = eval { shift->recv };
       if($@) {
         # handle error...
       }
   
       # send a message through the websocket...
       $connection->send('a message');
   
       # recieve message from the websocket...
       $connection->on_each_message(sub {
         my $message = shift;
         ...
       });
   
       # handle a closed connection...
       $connection->on_finish(sub {
         ...
       });
 
     });

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides an interface to interact with a web server that
    provides services via the WebSocket protocol in an AnyEvent context. It
    uses Protocol::WebSocket rather than reinventing the wheel. You could
    use AnyEvent and Protocol::WebSocket directly if you wanted finer grain
    control, but if that is not necessary then this class may save you some
    time.

ATTRIBUTES
  timeout
    Timeout for the initial connection to the web server. The default is 30.

  ssl_no_verify
    If set to true, then secure WebSockets (those that use SSL/TLS) will not
    be verified. The default is false.

  ssl_ca_file
    Provide your own CA certificates file instead of using the system
    default for SSL/TLS verification.

METHODS
  $client->connect($uri)
    Open a connection to the web server and open a WebSocket to the resource
    defined by the given URL. The URL may be either an instance of URI::ws,
    URI::wss, or a string that represents a legal WebSocket URL.

    This method will return an AnyEvent condition variable which you can
    attach a callback to. The value sent through the condition variable will
    be either an instance of AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection or a croak
    message indicating a failure. The synopsis above shows how to catch such
    errors using "eval".

CAVEATS
    This is pretty simple minded and there are probably WebSocket features
    that you might like to use that aren't supported by this distribution.
    Patches are encouraged to improve it.
