This is a silly little example that shows how you
can use AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client.

 - jobserver is a Mojolicious::Lite app (also requires Mojo::Redis
   and a redis server running on localhost) that cordinates and
   displays job output.
 
 - jobrunner is an AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client program that runs a
   program locally and sends the output as events via WebSocket
   to jobserver.
 
 - slowlast is just a program that runs last -30 very slowly so
   that you can see the output update on the server.
   
 - jobviewer is an AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client program that attaches
   to the jobserver and displays a job as it isrunning via 
   WebSockets.

There are probably a few bugs and race conditions (in particular
events may be missing for currently running jobs in the webapp
or from the jobviewer) and there are probably better ways to do
this sort of thing, but it demonstrates the library so there it
is.

Instructions:

  - install the prereqs if they aren't there:
  
    % cpanm JSON AnyEvent AnyEvent::Open3::Simple       \
    AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client Mojolicious Mojo::Redis \
    LWP::UserAgent URI Text::Table

  - start the jobserver 
  
    % jobserver
    
  - in another window run a slow running process that produces
    some output, you can use slowlast as an example that comes
    with this distro
    
    % slowlast
  
  - in your web browser, go to the jobserver url and navigate
    to the slow running process.  You should see the existing
    output, plus any new output as it gets sent through the 
    job server.
  
    http://localhost:3000

  - in another window (again!) you can use jobviewer to watch
    a job in process:
    
    % jobviewer
    ... lists jobs managed by jobserver
    % jobviewer 1234:1
    ... watch job 1234:1
